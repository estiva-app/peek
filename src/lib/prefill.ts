/**
 * Prefilling a launcher form from the conversation (PEE-5).
 *
 * **The insight the whole feature rests on:** a manifest action's `input` is
 * already a JSON Schema, and the Prompt API takes a JSON Schema as
 * `responseConstraint`. So the same declaration that draws the form constrains
 * the model — no mapping layer, no per-app prompt engineering, and an HR tool
 * declaring `add-candidate` gets prefill on the day it publishes its manifest.
 *
 * **The second half of that is conditional, and PEE-5 assumed it was not.**
 * Measured in Chrome on 2026-09-02: a build with speculative decoding (MTP)
 * enabled *refuses* `responseConstraint` outright, while simultaneously
 * requiring explicit sampling options for the same reason. So the declaration
 * cannot always be the constraint. What survives is the more important half —
 * the fields asked for are still generated from the declaration, as words
 * rather than as a schema (`promptApi`'s `jsonHint`), so an app nobody here
 * wrote still gets prefill the day it publishes a manifest. The elegance was
 * conditional; the interoperability was not.
 *
 * The schema here is rebuilt from the **fields the form actually drew**
 * (`FormField[]`) rather than from the manifest's raw `input`. The runtime does
 * not carry the raw schema through, and rebuilding turns out to be the better
 * end anyway: it guarantees the model is constrained to exactly what the person
 * can see and edit. A constraint listing a property the consumer chose not to
 * draw would put a value in a form with nowhere to show it.

/**
 * How much of the thread to send. **Measured, not guessed (INT-1).**
 *
 * PEE-5 left this open — *"the choice is worth testing rather than deciding on
 * paper"* — and 4000 was a stated default nobody had tested. Chrome, Gemini
 * Nano, 2026-09-02, via `__promptContext.sweep()`, asking for a one-word answer
 * so the number is the cost of the *input* rather than of a generation:
 *
 * | characters | time to answer |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | 4 000 | 1.8 s |
 * | 8 000 | 2.3 s |
 * | 16 000 | 4.1 s |
 * | 32 000 | 9.1 s |
 * | 64 000 | refused — *"The input is too large."* |
 *
 * **The cost is super-linear**, which is what attention does: the marginal cost
 * per character roughly triples between 4k and 32k. So the ceiling is not the
 * interesting bound — 32k answers, and takes nine seconds doing it.
 *
 * **8000 is chosen for where the curve is still cheap**, not for how much fits.
 * It doubles what a capture sees for half a second, covers roughly 34 messages
 * at this workspace's ~234 characters each, and leaves the whole super-linear
 * region unspent. Two reasons not to take more:
 *
 * - The sweep asked for one word. A real feature generates a paragraph, and
 *   that time lands **on top** of every figure above.
 * - Prefill is unsolicited. It races somebody already typing into the form, so
 *   it is the latency-sensitive caller — INT-3, where a person has asked and
 *   knows they are waiting, can afford a larger budget of its own.
 *
 * The measured evidence that 4000 was too small: a real 9-message thread of
 * 5795 characters was cut to 2465 by this bound — 57% of the conversation
 * discarded — and the untruncated version answered *faster* than the truncated
 * one, both being inside the noise floor.
