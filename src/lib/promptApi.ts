/**
 * The browser's on-device Prompt API, wrapped (PEE-5, PEE-6).
 *
 * **Named for the API, not a vendor.** Nothing here detects a browser: the only
 * gate is `typeof globalThis.LanguageModel`, so any engine exposing the
 * interface gets prefill.
 *
 * ## What the two browsers actually did, 2026-09-02
 *
 * | | `LanguageModel` | `availability()` | `create()` |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Chrome | `function` | `unavailable` | **works** — prefill confirmed by a person |
 * | Edge | `function` | `unavailable` | throws *"The feature flag gating model execution was disabled"* |
 *
 * Both **expose** the interface; only Chrome would **run** it. Edge's refusal is
 * a browser policy gate rather than anything a consumer can influence, and it
 * arrives as a `create()` throw — which `createSession` already treats as "this
 * browser does not get prefill". So Edge degrading to a plain form is PEE-6
 * behaving correctly, not a defect to chase.
 *
 * Worth knowing when judging output quality: the model differs by browser, so a
 * verdict on a suggestion is a verdict on *whichever model answered*, and should
 * say which. Chrome's is Gemini Nano; Edge ships its own.
 *
 * > **Miky, 2026-08-31** — *"Explore Prompt API as it could allow us cheaply
 * > prefill the form based on the context from the thread."*
 *
 * **On-device is the point, not a detail.** The model runs locally, whichever
 * one the browser ships. A work thread is
 * confidential, and posting one to a cloud model to save somebody typing would
 * be a disclosure. This is the only shape of the feature consistent with how
 * the rest of the suite treats a Folder nobody outside it can read.
 *
 * Nothing here is in `lib.dom` yet, so the surface is declared below — narrowly,
 * covering only what is used. A wider guess at an API this new would be a
 * fiction that typechecks.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * **It never blocks on the download** (PEE-6). First use per origin fetches a
 * multi-gigabyte model; a form that waits for that is broken for the person
 * who just wanted to type a title. `availability()` is consulted first and
 * `'downloadable'` is treated as *not available now* — true, and it keeps the
 * caller from starting a download nobody asked for.
 *
 * **It does offer one, since INT-10.** Treating `'downloadable'` as
 * unavailable and never offering the fetch anywhere left a machine that could
 * run the model waiting on a page that would not ask — see `downloadModel`,
 * which is the one path here a person starts deliberately.
 */

/** What `LanguageModel.availability()` answers. */
export type ModelAvailability = 'unavailable' | 'downloadable' | 'downloading' | 'available'

/**
 * What `prefillAvailability` reports — the browser's four answers, plus the
 * case where it gives none at all.
 *
 * `'unanswered'` is deliberately not folded into `'unavailable'`. The two call
 * for opposite handling: `'unavailable'` is a browser that answered, and the
 * gate attempts a session anyway because Chrome says it while working. A
 * browser that never answers has demonstrated nothing except that awaiting it
 * is unsafe, and attempting a session on that basis is how a launcher ends up
 * showing a row that hangs.

 *
 * | call | outcome |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `LanguageModel.availability()`, and all six option spellings | **never settled** |
 * | `Summarizer` / `Writer` / `Rewriter` `.availability()` | **never settled** |
 * | `LanguageDetector.availability()` | `available`, in 0 ms |
 * | `Proofreader` | absent |
 *
 * So the on-device stack is alive and answering — the generative half simply
 * never replies. `prefillAvailability` awaited it with no deadline, so the
 * launcher's model state stayed unresolved for the life of the page: no Ask
 * row, no download offer, and nothing anywhere saying why.
 *
 * This is a change from Edge 154, which *answered* `'unavailable'` and threw

 * replies is not, which is why the deadline is the fix rather than a guess at

 * for, in a place nobody thought to look because this call is metadata rather
 * than generation and is supposed to return in milliseconds.
