 * for the actions no app declares yet.
 *
 * The conversion is small because the registry was written in the manifest's

 *
 * - **The parent is not a property.** It comes from `emits.toAddressOf: 'self'`
 *   — surfaced by the runtime as `createsUnder` — and it is the half of "needs
 *   a form *and a parent*" that made these unrenderable. A form drawing only
 *   the declared properties would publish an orphan, so the field is synthesised
 *   here and marked required.
 * - **A label is the consumer's business.** The manifest names a property
 *   (`title`); what a person reads above the box is Peek's to choose, the same
 *   split `ForeignObjectWidget` makes for reading. Title-casing the property is
 *   a default, not a declaration.

 * draw prose instead of a single line; it does not have to, and one that
 * ignores it still publishes the right event."* Peek uses it, because a
 * one-line box for a conversation opener is the wrong shape for the thing.
 *
 * **`prose` is the same move one step further** (MAN-1, RIC-13). A content
 * field may also declare `format: 'estiva-blocks-1'` — the owner accepts a
 * block document there — and interop surfaces it as `field.format` only when
