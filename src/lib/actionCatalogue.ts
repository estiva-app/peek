 * INT-5 — choosing, from what was said, an action some app declared.

 * **Nothing in this file knows what any app is.** Not Ship, not an issue, not a
 * project. It reasons over `ResolvedAction`s that arrived from manifests at
 * runtime, and the test it is written against is RFC 0.4 §15's: an app nobody
 * here wrote publishes a manifest, and this works for it the same day. If a
 * name of an app or an object appears below, it is a bug.
 *
 * The material it matches on already exists. RFC 0.4 §13.4 took two seams
 * early — an action's `description` and its `effect` — and `ResolvedAction`
 * carries both, annotated *"Carried through, never rendered here"*. They were
 * taken for a consumer that reasons. This is that consumer.
