/**
 * Finding things from the launcher (PEE-4).
 *
 * > **Miky, 2026-08-19** — *"We could also add basic Topic search and People /
 * > Team search to make it little bit more useful."*
 *
 * One rule for the whole panel (SPEC §5.2): every typed word matches the start
 * of a word, in any order; `"…"` is those whole words next to each other, and
 * `-word` leaves out anything with a word starting that way. What Peek holds
 * on the device — people, apps, actions — is matched by `referenceMatch`, the
 * rule's reader half; files and messages are the relay's, asked from the
 * second letter typed. So "remov short" finds *Remove Short summary…* the same
 * way in every section, and nothing is found by the middle of a word: "aud"
 * no longer finds Claude.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-19 the relay matched whole words over Peek's socket, so a
 * message section had to say "needs a whole word" while the device's lists
 * matched any fragment. The relay now answers by word starts on every
 * connection, and the hint went with it.
 *
 * The message corpus is both kinds a conversation is written in — `kind:9`
 * in a topic and `kind:1111` on a file — since FOL-36; a hit's own tags say
 * which page it opens on (`MessageHit.file`).

 * claimed in its own header to *"power the launcher's 'In Peek' results"*, and
 * was imported by nothing. It searched the `TOPICS` / `TOPIC_CONVERSATIONS`
 * fixtures directly — so it could never see a message from production, which is
 * presumably why it fell out of use when the mock apps went (2026-08-31). This
 * function was the one part worth keeping; the file is deleted rather than left
 * beside a real implementation for somebody to find and trust.
