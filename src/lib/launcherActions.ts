/**
 * The launcher's app and action registry — manifest-shaped, deliberately.
 *
 * Everything the Cmd+K launcher lists is declared here in the same vocabulary
 * an app's NIP-89 manifest uses (`interop/projection.ts` `ManifestAction`,
 * RFC 0.4 §13.4): an action is `{ id, label, appliesTo, emits, input }`, and a
 * form is drawn FROM that declaration rather than hand-built per app. That is
 * the point of the exercise — the Intelligence runtime will hand the launcher
 * real manifests, and swapping this constant for a live read must not reshape
 * any UI.
 *
 * Two kinds of honesty are kept apart:
 *
 * - `declaredToday: true` marks what the owning app's live manifest actually
 *   declares right now (Ship's `add-issue` declares exactly `{ title }`).
 * - Everything else is this design's PROPOSAL for what the manifest should
 *   grow. Peek's own manifest deliberately declares no actions yet
 *   (`src/nostr/manifest.ts` says why), so both Peek actions are proposals.
 *
 * Submitting a form publishes for real where the live manifest declares the
 * action (PEE-1) and leaves its reference in the composer (PEE-2) — see
 * `CommandLauncher`'s `submitAction`. Publishing a guess at another app's
 * object is what the honour system forbids.
 *
 * **The launcher no longer lists the actions below** (INT-9). It reads each
 * app's manifest and offers what that declares; what is here is the app, its
 * parent kind, its labels, and a proposal for each action the manifest should
 * grow. The proposals are kept here as the design's record of the intended field
 * shapes, and nothing draws them: the Launcher stories that did were removed with
 * UIG-29 (Katerina, 16 September — they were not representative of the launcher).
 *
 * The three that stayed inert were `add-project`, `say` and `create-topic`,
 * and Miky found all three the same way: open the form, fill it, submit,
 * nothing happens. They become real when PRO-18 lets an action create a
 * Folder — a Ship project is a Folder plus a record, and a Peek conversation
 * is scoped by one — at which point Ship and Peek declare them and these
 * literals go.
