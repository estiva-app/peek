/**
 * INT-5 — the selection, and the reason it is safe.
 *
 * The property under test is not "the model picks well". It is that **whatever
 * the model says, only a real declared action can come out** — because
 * structured output is refused on some builds, so this answer arrives through
 * the lenient path and can be anything at all.
 *
 * There is a second property these tests are written to keep, and it is the
 * one that would be easiest to lose in a later edit: **nothing here names an
 * app or an object.** The fixtures below are deliberately an app nobody has
 * written, declaring an action nobody has declared. If a future change makes
 * these tests need Ship, or an issue, the change is the bug.
